## Projects

Here are some of the cool things Iâ€™ve built:

- **Malicious URL Checker**  
  A FastAPI-based backend that classifies URLs as malicious or benign using a trained ML model. Integrated with a Chrome extension for real-time website risk detection.

- **Sentiment Analysis for Human-AI Interaction**  
  An end-to-end pipeline that transcribes audio from driving simulation experiments, analyzes sentiment using a transformer model, and visualizes results in Python.

- **Credit Risk Prediction**  
  A machine learning model to classify loan applicants as good/bad credit risk using the German Credit dataset, deployed with Streamlit UI for interactive demos.

- **Dog Breed Classification**  
  A deep learning app using Keras and transfer learning (ResNet-50 & NASNet) to classify dog breeds with high accuracy.
